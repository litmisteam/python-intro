# Step 1: Understanding PASE

The [IBM i Knowledge Center](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/) has this to say about [PASE](https://kti.news/pase-v73):

> PASE for i enables you to run many of your AIX® applications on the IBM® i operating system with little or no change, and effectively expands your platform solution portfolio.

They should end that sentence with an exclamation point to convey the incredible amount of possibilities this opens for IBM i. Some quick things that can be attributed to PASE \(listed in alphabetical order\):

* [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com)
* [Java](https://java.com/en/)
* [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/)
* [Perl](https://www.perl.org/)
* [PHP](http://php.net/) from [Zend](http://zend.com)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Redis](https://redis.io/)
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) from [PowerRuby](http://powerruby.com)
* [SFTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol)

* zip and unzip

## PASE **≅** AIX **≅** Linux {#_pase_is_like_aix_is_like_linux}

With IBM Portable Application Solutions Environment for i \(PASE for i\), you can port IBM AIX applications to the IBM i platform with minimal effort. It provides an integrated runtime environment that allows you to run selected applications without the complexity of managing operating systems.

PASE is more or less AIX running on an IBM i and is using IBM i as its kernel. This is why the majority of AIX binaries run in PASE unchanged. AIX has many similarities to Linux. Because of the close affinity AIX has with Linux it means many things birthed in the Linux world can be made to work in PASE on IBM i.
