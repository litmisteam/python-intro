# Step 2: Learn Python with Bottle

While using the interpreter can open up a range of resources for Python development and help speed up ingestion of the language syntax, some would argue that jumping right in and making use of one of the many public libraries available to Python users does a better job illustrating the power of the language. [Bottle](https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/) is a fast, simple and lightweight WSGI micro web-framework for Python distributed as a single file module with no dependencies other than the Python standard library, making it a perfect candidate to illustrate the power behind Python and why its inclusion into the PASE environment is so monumental.

### Characteristics

Bottle supports the use of clean and dynamic URLs through its routing functions. Bottle is also compatible with many major template engines like Mako, Jinja2 and Cheetah to name a few. Form data, file uploads, cookies and other HTTP-related metadata is made conveniently accessible with Bottle's extensive metadata access methods. Bottle ships with a built-in HTTP development server supporting paste, fapws3, bjoern, gae, cherrypy or any WSGI capable HTTP server.

### Getting Started

To get started, enter the shell interface from the workspaces page of your Litmis Space. Submit the following 'pip' command and review the response, it should look something like this:

```text
[usr3ouav@SPACES]~% pip3 install bottle
Collecting bottle
Installing collected packages: bottle
Successfully installed bottle-0.12.13
[usr3ouav@SPACES]~%
```

If you're unsure of the installation enter the pip3 list command into your shell to view your installed Python modules \(beyond the Python standard library\). You will likely only have a subset of this list, as it only lists what you have installed. 

```text
[usr3ouav@SPACES]~% pip3 list
DEPRECATION: The default format will switch to columns in the future. You can use --format=(legacy|columns) (or define a format=(legacy|columns) in your pip.conf under the [list] section) to disable this warning.
appdirs (1.4.0)
bottle (0.12.13)
ibm-db (2.0.5.4)
packaging (16.8)
pip (9.0.1)
pyparsing (2.1.10)
pytz (2016.10)
setuptools (34.0.2)
simplejson (3.10.0)
six (1.10.0)
textblob (0.11.1)
wheel (0.29.0)
[usr3ouav@SPACES]~%
```

To set up our Bottle project we can take a number of routes. We could either enter a Python interpreter and run a short segment of code to see it in action, or we could put this short piece of code in a file and execute the file through the shell interface. Furthermore, we can either go to the code editor to create the files we will need, or we can do so through the shell. First, I will illustrate how we can create the file we need to run with shell commands, and then I'll demonstrate an alternative via the code editor. Enter the following commands in your shell interface and review the responses. \(the sample text below may contain files you do not have yet, if you have never used your Litmis Space before\)

```text
[usr3ouav@SPACES]~% ls
Templates            bottle_jinja_cherry  cloud9_server.pid    django_Files         ibm_db_Files         mako_Files
bottle_Files         cherrypy_Files       core                 htmlstyle_Files      jinja2_Files
[usr3ouav@SPACES]~% mkdir bottleLearning
[usr3ouav@SPACES]~% ls
Templates            bottle_Files         cherrypy_Files       core                 htmlstyle_Files      jinja2_Files
bottleLearning       bottle_jinja_cherry  cloud9_server.pid    django_Files         ibm_db_Files         mako_Files
[usr3ouav@SPACES]~% cd bottleLearning
[usr3ouav@SPACES]~/bottleLearning% ls
[usr3ouav@SPACES]~/bottleLearning% touch firstBottleExample.py
[usr3ouav@SPACES]~/bottleLearning% ls
firstBottleExample.py
[usr3ouav@SPACES]~/bottleLearning%
```

To break down the above we need to assess what all of the shell commands were. First, 'ls' was entered to list the contents of the current working directory. The next command, 'mkdir', created a new directory inside the current directory \(which should be the home directory on startup\). The second 'ls' command was sent to illustrate the completion of the 'mkdir' command \(notice the 'bottleLearning' listing under this command\). Once the new directory was created, the 'cd' command was issued to change the working directory to the newly created 'bottleLearning' directory. From that point the contents were listed using the 'ls' command, which displayed nothing, followed by the touch command, which generated the file we set out to create in the first place \('firstBottleExample.py'\).

At this point you can enter the code editor through the Litmis Spaces homepage:

![](../.gitbook/assets/codeeditor.png)

Your code editor should look something like this:

![](../.gitbook/assets/codeeditorscreen.png)

You might not be able to see the file we supposedly created in the shell prompt above. To view this file you may need to refresh your workstation by right-clicking on your username and selecting refresh as shown below:

![](../.gitbook/assets/refreshcodeeditor.png)

Now that your workstation is refreshed, you can go ahead and begin editing the file we created by selecting the down arrow on the 'bottleLearning' folder that contains our desired file and double-clicking on the file to pull it up in the editor.

![](../.gitbook/assets/selectingfileineditor.png)

At this point we are ready to begin editing our file. Enter the following lines of code into your 'firstBottleExample.py' file:

```text
from bottle import route, run, template

@route('/hello/<name>')
def index(name):
    return template('<b>Hello {{name}}</b>!', name=name)

run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)
```

These lines represent one of the most basic Bottle structures you can engineer, and when run, should start the built in Bottle server on the given host at the provided port number that serves HTTP GET requests with the appropriate routing as defined in the '@route' attribute parameters. However, for our purposes we are going to need to update the host and port parameters in the run command with our personal Litmis Space information. To find this information navigate to the Litmis Spaces workspaces page and select the 'More Info' icon.

![](../.gitbook/assets/informationicon.png)

You are going to need the following host and port information from this section:

![](../.gitbook/assets/hostandportinfo.png)

Based on the information from my own info page my finished 'firstBottleExample.py' code would look like this:

```text
from bottle import route, run, template

@route('/hello/<name>')
def index(name):
    return template('<b>Hello {{name}}</b>!', name=name)

run(host='0.0.0.0', port=62368)
```

Make sure you save the 'firstBottleExample.py' file by selecting 'File' and 'Save' from your code editor or simply use the 'ctrl-s' hotkey to update the IFS \(Integrated File System\) for your space. If you haven't saved your file since your last edit the code editor interface will display an '\*' symbol next to the name of your file at the top of your display. After saving, we are now ready to execute this code and start hosting our application at the given host and port address. Head over to the shell interface and enter the following to execute your 'firstBottleExample.py' code:

```text
[usr3ouav@SPACES]~% ls
Templates            bottle_Files         cherrypy_Files       core                 htmlstyle_Files      jinja2_Files
bottleLearning       bottle_jinja_cherry  cloud9_server.pid    django_Files         ibm_db_Files         mako_Files
[usr3ouav@SPACES]~% cd bottleLearning
[usr3ouav@SPACES]~/bottleLearning% ls
firstBottleExample.py
[usr3ouav@SPACES]~/bottleLearning% python3 firstBottleExample.py
Bottle v0.12.13 server starting up (using WSGIRefServer())...
Listening on http://spaces.litmis.com:62368/
Hit Ctrl-C to quit.
```

Restarting the console resets your directory setting so using an 'ls' command to determine your whereabouts in the IFS is a good way to start any shell entry. Using the 'cd' command to change directories to the 'bottleLearning' directory and using 'ls' to list its contents is a way to display a text readout of the filename we are trying to use so that we can avoid any syntax errors in our execution statement. Once in the correct directory you can then issue the 'python3 firstBottleExample.py' command as shown to run the interpreter and execute the file contents. This runs the code we saved in the 'firstBottleExample.py' file, starting a server at the requested host and port number as outlined in the file, which produces the output shown. To stop the server, press 'ctrl-c' from inside the shell interface. Copy and paste the URL listed at the 'Listening on http://...' line into a browser to view the server response based on our code entry!

If you're unfamiliar with the routing we defined, here are some examples of valid routes this code will accept:

![](../.gitbook/assets/routinginbrowserexample.png)

![](../.gitbook/assets/firefoxroutingexamplewitharrows.png)

Simply enter the host name, port address and the proper routing configuration and you should see a response in a browser based on code that you just entered! Congratulations on your first webpage using Python's Bottle module! Move on to Step 3 for more advanced Bottle topics and examples or skip ahead to a different topic if you so choose!
