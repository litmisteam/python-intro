`print('Intro To Python on IBM i')`

\*Near duplicates of the 'PASE' and 'IBM i Access' sections of this thread can be found under the PASE Intro on the '@litmis' gitbook page at [https://www.gitbook.com/@litmis](https://www.gitbook.com/@litmis) and were originally produced by Aaron Bartell. These were used as direct templates for the introductory sections where only minor edits were made. Furthermore, I would like to thank the Bottle community for providing excellent documentation. Many of the things found in this tutorial are covered in a more technical and verbose fashion at the [http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/) site.

Feel free to contact me with questions, concerns or advice at Eric.Newman@ibm.com or by forking this project and submitting a change request!
