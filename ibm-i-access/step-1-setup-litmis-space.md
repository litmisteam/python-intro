# Step 1: Setup Litmis Space

## Tutorial Environment

### Setup a LITMIS Space

Now that you know a little about PASE it’s time to setup your lab on an IBM i in the cloud. Labs are conducted on [**Litmis Spaces**](https://kti.news/2iMWsjL)** Multi Tenant**; a service from Krengeltech to provide preconfigured open source environments on IBM i cloud instances.

**In short, everything can be done through the browser - no need to install a source editor or shell client on your desktop. Happy day!**

Go to [https://spaces.litmis.com](https://spaces.litmis.com) and select SIGN UP, as show below.

Select the authentication mechanism of your choice. If you don’t have an account with the options listed, sign up for a free [Github.com](http://github.com) profile and return back to this page once your Github profile is setup.

Once logged in you can create a new space, as shown below.

You will be presented with the below pop-up. Give a name to this space, enter the promo code of **BETA**, select the `minimal` radio button, and click the **Create** button.![](../.gitbook/assets/pythonflavorlitmissetup.png)Now you should see a new box on your page that represents your newly created Space \(demo picture Space was named 'ExampleSpace' instead of 'pythonIntro' as shown in the above setup\).

There are four buttons which constitute actions you can take with your Space. They are \(left to right\):

* **Shell prompt.** You will use this to enter commands in the PASE \(see the PASE tutorial at [https://www.gitbook.com/book/litmis/pase-intro/details](https://www.gitbook.com/book/litmis/pase-intro/details) for more details\) environment on the IBM i.
* **Editor.** Where you will edit your source code and navigate the IFS \(Integrated File System\).
* **Space Information.** Here you will find information about your space such as user profile, database schemas \(aka libraries\), ports for your web app to listen, Space id, etc.
* **Delete Space. WARNING!** If you select this option and the subsequent warning prompt, your Space will be deleted. This **CANNOT** be undone.

## Environment Variables

Each environment has specific settings that are stored in PASE environment variables. They are as follows. When you log into a PASE shell these are automatically set for you. You should not modify these values.

```text
export LITMIS_SPACE_GUID=xxxx
export LITMIS_SPACE_USER=USRxxxxx
export LITMIS_SCHEMA_DEVELOPMENT=xxxxx_D
export LITMIS_SCHEMA_TEST=xxxxx_T
export LITMIS_SCHEMA_PRODUCTION=xxxxx_P
export LITMIS_PORT_DEVELOPMENT=11111
export LITMIS_PORT_TEST=22222
export LITMIS_PORT_PRODUCTION=33333
```
